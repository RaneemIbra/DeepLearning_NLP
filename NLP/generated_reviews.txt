1. The movie was really good. The acting wasn't great, but the soundtrack had a lot going for it.<br /><strong>I think this is one of my favorite films from '80s/'90's!<span style="color:#cc4900;">It has all these wonderful sounds and tones that are very close to what you'd expect in an 80's film studio (like with "Strange Case"). I can tell because after watching everything on screen there isn- <a
2. The movie was a very funny one, I think that is what makes it so good. It touches upon many different kinds of fun and interesting ideas about film making.<br /><span style="color: #E2D78A;">It has some wonderful dialogues but nothing quite like the kind you will find in this classic! Also note how little dialogue there really isn't - almost all English sounds are either used to describe words or just plain speech patterns (which can be confusing at times
3. The movie was produced by Neil Simon, who wrote and directed the film. He is best known for his roles in such films as Forrest Gump & Johnny Mathis' Boys From The Sea (1949) , Paradise Lost II: A Life In French Foul Play And Two Little Pigs . His other credits include Alice Munro's Cinderella 's Mother Of Sinners et Juliette Maillardia,' Mr.' Garfield...Simon appears sporadically on screen including a 1971 co-production with Henry
4. The movie was a masterpiece. I saw it twice.<br /><span style="font-size: 12px;">Even though the title text is "Spoilers ahead," you can still get an edge from watching this one alone and uncritically (although some viewers will find that its ambiguity creates unnecessary drama). The dialog, however unhelpful at times during dialogue between two young girls about their future together ("What if my brother were alive now?"), adds to what's already been
5. The movie was produced by Judd Apatow and directed mainly in English, with special emphasis on the French version. The main character is played quite delicately: her father appears as a chauffer; an extra-marital friend introduces herself only after having been asked to go see him play chess at school (he does not); she has no idea that he's also famous for playing piano.<br /><strong>Judd adds depth through dialogue which conveys "I'm so sorry." He

1. The movie was terrible. I can honestly say that the director wasn't very happy with his actors and script writing, which is why this film has been rated R for violence/suspense.<br /><img class="styles__noscript" src='https://dsx-media_ready...2ezK5r1q6j9s40zw30nFyCiRcGifYWdlg==' />I didn´t like any of them--
2. The movie was supposed to be about the life of a boy who falls in love with an attractive woman. But instead, we see him being tortured by his girlfriend and spent half naked on her bed before he is strangled (this isn't actually illegal behavior). It's extremely un-funny.<br /><strong>Plot: The film starts off very well - there are no spoilers at all! You'll notice that they put nudity into every scene so you can judge for yourself whether or not
3. The movie was shot in 3D, so you have to be very careful not how close the characters are drawn. I mean... it's hard getting into a Bond film when they're just staring at nothing but stars and women.<br /><span class="fullscreen" data-confirmation='no_show\" id=144131068&viewerinpt>Yes! But that doesn't make this any better than "Red Eye", which has all kinds of supernatural elements (even
4. The movie was a shock to me. I don't know why the director had his budget so low, because he spent most of it on character development and plot holes.<br /><strong>I'm not sure if there were any twists or flaws in this story; we're introduced as two young people who have different kinds (and talents) but are all alike: intelligent-but--well put!--already very special individuals with unique skills that will change their ways throughout life without warning.</span
5. The movie was terrible. I don't know why, but the director had to take a budget of Godzilla or The Jungle Book and make this one.<br />< br />If you're looking for something completely different than what we've seen so far in our history books (or if your taste is mild), then check out Trish McPherson's excellent film version!<strong> <a href="http://www-livescience4u...cities/20131130_
